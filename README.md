# Plant Labels

## Introduction

A plant label is a small (typically plastic) label that you write on, and stick
into the soil proximal to a plant. I have found that 3D printing the plant
labels appears to be cheaper than buying them from a garden store (plus PLA is
biodegradeable), so I created this simple project.

## Repository Information

This repository contains CAD files for various plant labels variants:
- [Stake Variant](./stake-variant)

Within each variant's subdirectory there are folders containing the CAD project 
files, technical drawings, and 3D models in STL and STEP formats.
